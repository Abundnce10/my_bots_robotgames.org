> robot game is a game for hackers. You write robots in Python, test them with our kit, and submit them to our server. A cron job matches up all the robots throughout the day, and you can also challenge other robots yourself.

This is a simple AI that attacks when any opponent robots are nearby, otherwise they head towards the middle of the arena
